# Whose stack is it anyway?
## A technical guesing game [](#post)

`28 February 2024` `| AoIR 2024 workshop submission` 
> Choosing the right tech for our projects can feel nothing short of a gamble. 
> Whether you're building research or industry products, the tools we use often remain veiled in shrouds of technical terms, outdated dependencies and obscure documentationâ€”if available at all. 
> The stack, or more often, your stack, comprises the very tooling infrastructure that enables you to do technical work, from charting data to packaging websites and authoring collaborative documents to hosting fully distributed computing clusters. 
> Ideally, meticulously organised (but more likely barely standing), these towering builds can be found at any scale: take out one piece and watch them come tumbling down.

More concretely, stacks compromise the soft- and hardware components, tools, chains and modules that your project simply cannot function without (Leeftink & Angus, 2022)/
Or rather, no project can function without: all our digital work depends on a long-winded road of developer considerations stretching as far as the first operating systems and likely much further. 
When operational, 'just' a friendly interface to our files and data. 
But once something breaks, good luck sifting through year old bulletin boards, cryptic help messages and 240p instructional videos to retrieve that checkbox you should have set during installation, comfortably tucked under a five-level deep configuration menu.

But stacks do not just influence our work when they break: the slew of assumptions baked-into each element results in a terribly complex assemblage of distributed ownership and responsibility, significantly shaping what you can and cannot technically do. 
What file types are accepted? Which languages are supported? How can interfaces be operated? Customised? Which legacy technologies are depended on? Who made these decisions in the first place? 
When developer considerations are distributed this far and wide, you cannot help but wonder: *whose stack is it anyway*?

### Game setup
This workshop is based on a collaborative game where we try to answer just that. 
Your participation will attune you to the popular (but often obfuscated stacks) used by industry and academia and the non-level playing field on which they are built. 
Contestants are given handles to map a (research) stack of choice, and through role reversal are given the opportunity to guess which industry or academic players were involved in their creation. 
The rules are simple:

- Participants are divided into subgroups and assigned team A and B.
- Both are given a demo on how to use a .stackfile and inspect package.json requirements.
- Participants are asked to determine which dependencies are distinctive to a particular project's tech stack.
- Teams have to present and guess which project (e.g. SciPy, Typst, Enso, Chat-GPT) the other team's dependencies are part of.
- Points are won if the opposing team infers which dependencies belong to what project (in other words, points are gained when the other team makes a right guess).

There is room for 24 participants. For effective participation, please register a GitHub account and bring a connected device,
